## [1.1.8+4] - 26/07/2020
* Fixes #76

## [1.1.8+3] - 19/07/2020
* Updated Gherkin library version to allow for function step implementations; updated docs to match.
* Add steps `SiblingContainsText`, `SwipeOnKey`, `SwipeOnText`, `TapTextWithinWidget`, `TapWidgetOfType`, `TapWidgetOfTypeWithin`, `TapWidgetWithText`, `TextExists`, `TextExistsWithin`, `WaitUntilKeyExists`, and `WaitUntilTypeExists` . Thanks to @tshedor for the PR!

## [1.1.8+2] - 11/05/2020

* Fixed issue where the connection attempt of Flutter driver would not retry before throwing a connection error.  This was causing an error on some machines trying to connect to an Android emulator (x86 & x86_64) that runs the googleapis (see https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/42433)
* Added a before `onBeforeFlutterDriverConnect` and after `onAfterFlutterDriverConnect` Flutter driver connection method property to the test configuration `FlutterTestConfiguration` to enable custom logic before and after a driver connection attempt.
* Updated Gherkin library version to sort issue with JSON reporter throwing error when an exception is logged before any steps have run

## [1.1.8+1] - 09/05/2020

* Updated Gherkin library version to sort issue with JSON reporter throwing error when an exception is logged before any feature have run

## [1.1.8] - 08/05/2020

* Updated library to work with the new way the Flutter stable branch manages logging for Flutter driver
* Added the ability to test against an already running app; enabling you to debug a running application while it has tests executed against it.  Setting the configuration property `runningAppProtocolEndpointUri` to the service protocol endpoint (found in stdout when an app has `--verbose` logging turned on) will ensure that the existing app is connected to rather than starting a new instance of the app.  NOTE: ensure the app you are trying to connect to calls `enableFlutterDriverExtension()` when it starts up otherwise the Flutter Driver will not be able to connect to it.
* **BREAKING CHANGE** Fixed spelling mistake of `targetAppWorkingDirectory` & `flutterDriverMaxConnectionAttempts` in `FlutterTestConfiguration`
* **BREAKING CHANGE** reverse order of `driver` and `finder` in `FlutterDriverUtils#isPresent` . This makes this method's arguments more consistent with all other instance methods in the class by including `driver` first.
* `expect` the presence of `ThenExpectWidgetToBePresent` . If the widget was not present, the method would simply timeout and not report an error for the step.

## [1.1.7+6] - 04/03/2020

* Updated to latest Gherkin library (see https://github.com/jonsamwell/dart_gherkin/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#117---04032020) - this includes a breaking change to the `Hook` interface that will need to be updated if any of the `Scenario` level methods are implemented
* Ensured the well known step `I tap the ".." button` scroll the element into view first

## [1.1.7+5] - 03/02/2020

* Updated to latest Gherkin library (see https://github.com/jonsamwell/dart_gherkin/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#1164---03022020)

## [1.1.7+4] - 31/01/2020

* Update check to determine if any devices are connected to run tests against
* When the flag `verboseFlutterProcessLogs` was true Flutter driver was preemptively connecting to the app when it was not ready

## [1.1.7+3] - 08/01/2020

* Added retry logic to the Flutter driver connect call to handle the seemingly random connection failures
* Ensured `AttachScreenshotOnFailedStepHook` cannot throw an unhandled exception causing the test run to stop
* Added new well known step `When I tap the back button` which finds and taps the default page back button
* Added a new well known step `Then I expect the widget 'notification' to be present within 2 seconds` which expects a widget with a given key to be present within n seconds
* Updated Gherkin library version

## [1.1.7+2] - 07/01/2020

* Increased the Flutter driver reconnection delay to try and overcome some driver to app connection issues on slower machines

## [1.1.7+1] - 07/01/2020

* Ensured when the Flutter driver is closed it cannot throw an unhandled exception causing the test run the stop
* Updated Gherkin library version

## [1.1.7] - 06/01/2020

* `WhenFillFieldStep` Ensure widget is scrolled into view before setting it's value
* Fixed lint warnings

## [1.1.5+2] - 19/12/2019

* When more than one connected device is present the device to run against was unknown causing a failure, now a message is logged saying the --device-id argument needs to be set
* Fixed issue where deprecated api warnings when build a flutter app were written to the stderr stream

## [1.1.5+1] - 18/12/2019

* Migrated example to AndroidX

## [1.1.5] - 05/12/2019

* Updated to latest Gherkin library (see https://github.com/jonsamwell/dart_gherkin/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#115---05122019)

## [1.1.4] - 27/09/2019

* Added configuration parameter `flutterBuildTimeout` to allow setting the app build wait timeout.  Slower machines may need longer to build and start the Flutter app under test.
* Now logging the flutter driver command used when the configuration setting `logFlutterProcessOutput` is true
* Verbose logging for the underlying Flutter process can be enabled via the configuration setting `verboseFlutterProcessLogs`
* Added `waitUntil` helper method to the `FlutterDriverUtils` class that waits until a certain provided condition is true

## [1.1.3] - 25/09/2019

* Added Flutter driver reporter - the Flutter Driver logs all messages (even non-error ones) to stderr and will cause the process to be marked as failed by a CI server because of this.  So this reporter redirects the messages to the appropriate output stream (stdout / stderr).
* FlutterWorld - added missing `super.dispose()` call

## [1.1.2] - 22/09/2019

* Fixed lint warnings

## [1.1.1] - 22/09/2019

* Updated to latest Gherkin library

* Updated to latest Gherkin lib which implements languages - features can now be written in different languages / dialects! See https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/reference/#overview for supported dialects.
* Ensured the hook to take a screenshot `AttachScreenshotOnFailedStepHook` works for steps that error or timeout as well as fail.
* Fix missing await in `FlutterDriverUtils` when getting text of a widget.
